In Next.js, the error message indicating that the "component that is rendered on the client side is not the same as that rendered on the server side" typically arises from discrepancies between the HTML generated on the server and the HTML rehydrated on the client. This inconsistency can often be caused by conditional rendering based on client-side-only data or browser properties, like media queries. Here's a detailed look at why this happens and how to address it:

Why This Happens
Next.js uses server-side rendering (SSR) to generate the initial HTML of a page on the server, allowing faster load times and better SEO. When the page loads on the client, Next.js rehydrates this HTML, making it interactive by attaching the JavaScript necessary to handle user interactions and dynamic content.

However, SSR happens without access to the browser environment, meaning properties like window, document, and certain CSS media queries are unavailable on the server. When a component renders conditionally based on these client-only properties, it can produce a different HTML structure on the client compared to the server, causing a mismatch during hydration. This discrepancy triggers the error.

Example of the Issue
Let's say you have a component that conditionally renders content based on the screen width:

jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const isMobile = window.innerWidth < 768;

  return (
    <div>
      {isMobile ? <p>This is mobile view</p> : <p>This is desktop view</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
Since window.innerWidth is undefined on the server, this check will fail during SSR, resulting in different HTML structures for the server-rendered and client-rendered versions.

Solutions
1. Use useEffect for Client-Side Checks
One approach is to only perform the client-specific check in a useEffect hook, which runs only on the client after the component has been rendered:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setIsMobile(window.innerWidth < 768);
    handleResize(); // Set initial value
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {isMobile ? <p>This is mobile view</p> : <p>This is desktop view</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
In this version, the isMobile state is only set on the client side, preventing any discrepancy during SSR. This way, the server initially renders a consistent output, and the client updates the content based on the window width.

2. Conditional Rendering with useMediaQuery Hooks
If youâ€™re using a UI library like Material-UI that offers a useMediaQuery hook, you can conditionally set rendering based on screen size. However, remember to set the ssrMatchMedia option if you want SSR behavior to be predictable for specific viewports.

For example:

jsx
Copy code
import { useMediaQuery } from '@mui/material';
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width:768px)', { noSsr: true });

  return (
    <div>
      {isMobile ? <p>This is mobile view</p> : <p>This is desktop view</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
In this example, { noSsr: true } prevents the mismatch, ensuring that isMobile is only calculated on the client side.

3. Use Dynamic Import with ssr: false
Another approach is to dynamically import the component that relies on client-side properties and set ssr: false to disable SSR for that component entirely:

jsx
Copy code
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const MyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/MyComponent'), {
  ssr: false
});

export default function HomePage() {
  return <MyComponent />;
}
By disabling SSR for MyComponent, it will only render on the client, avoiding any mismatch error.

Summary
The Next.js hydration error usually happens because of server-side and client-side rendering inconsistencies, especially when using media queries or browser-specific properties. To prevent this:

Avoid client-specific conditions during SSR.
Use useEffect for client-only logic.
Leverage libraries with client-only rendering options.
Disable SSR for specific components if needed.
These practices ensure that your components render consistently across server and client, eliminating the hydration error.
